1.
Martial arts world.

"It's a space-sealing spell."

"Right now, our bodies aren't actually ours. But copies. It doesn't matter if we move outside the area. 
Our real body won't move. So it would be better to not try."

"The downside? Well, it seems this implementation basically also protects us from outside threat."

"The construction of this spell is quite intricate. I want to study it."

"Can we try to cut it directly?"

"Devouring Sword? Can you see its abstraction?
"No..."
"Then forget about it."

"Teacher. You said that our bodies still exist underneath the space-seal. What happen if we get stuck here
for a really long time."
"We're cultivators...
"A long time won't be long enough.

"Then what do we do?"

"First, we have to try to gain as much information as possible. For example."
"Since we know that this is a simulation that's running on top of reality. Is everything simulated?"
"Check our cultivation."
"It seems... to be in tact."
"Interesting.

"Dear disciple. Have you died before?"
"...Once."

"How did it happen?"
"A sword through the heart."
"Heroic."
"Why do you ask?"

"Would you mind dying again?"
"You're... implying that if we die in this space-sealing domain, we'll return to our bodies?"
"It's possible. But it's too risky. After all. If the space itself still exist.
"We'll just end up back here... correct?

"It's fake."
"What is?"
"My Karmic Saber. Right now, it might looks like its real counterpart. But it's just an illusion."
"So?"
"This means... it can't replicate our power. Which means it has limits.
"And if it has limits."

"If we can break it. We can break out. Or trigger some self-destruct process and we don't have to find out our selves
The worst case scenario."
"But how...?"

"Overload? Bruteforce? Or simply..."
"--Spell-disruption."

The space breaks.

"One danger of any mind-copying method is that while copying, it has to spent its stored energy to form the domain.
While the area energy is abundant. There are limits."

"Very interesting spell. I can think of a few ways to improve it. For example. Create a filter to check
the content of the simulation to prevent the victim from even thinking about things that might lead to 
their escape.
Or a way to recharge and pull in energy from a different dimensional portal entire to avoid the overloading problems
entirely. Well, at least against low-level cultivators.
Ah, another way to circumvent that problem would be to drain the energy diretcly off of the target.

"Now then... let's us walk."

But then.

"Teacher... are we... supposed to look like this?"
"..."
"This is... a curse that was set to be cast once the spell is broken right?
"...Yes."

[If you think it was going to be that easy... think again.]

"It seems like we've been had."
"I will track down this spell master and cut off his head."

Spell-Masters of the Eastern Providence.

2. Another martial arts world.

Can't rush this.

Established VS Built towards.

"You are my father in a different timeline."
"You are my mother."
"My teacher."
"My sworn-brother."

Surrounded by people. Serving under them. Learning from them. Selfishly... then selflessly.
A story about friendship and love because we're not above that, are we? 

Path of Strength.
"Connection isn't a substitute for strength. It is strength."

A normal person. Normality. Is the simply the state of something not being unique. In other words.
In order to be normal, you just have to not be alone.

3. 
Records of Martialistic Enlightenment.
Randomly helping each other. Being connected in weird ways.

A pattern start to emerge. Can't see the beginning. Can't see the end. But the path is clear.

Recording of the Sword God's enlightenment.
"A sword is a sword.
"Yes.
"A spear is a sword.
"What?
"Everything is a sword."
"Umm..."
"I am a sword."
"True... I supposed."
"I am a sword."

"Why exactly... did you do that?"
"Because... it's funny?"

Recording of the Mother of Heavenly Incantation's first spell.
"So it's like... begging for money?"
"What?"
"You know... when you want something from your online followings so you just -- beg."
"Huh?"
"Please! I need a teleportation spell to find this criminal. Pretty please~!"
"..!"

"If you're going to write dialogues. Don't be too meta with it."

4. 
Giant creatures.
Giant spirits.
Ruins.
Shanty-Town.
Hunt with a spear.
Sub-cultures of this continent. Tribes that have tied to certain mythical creatures. Gods of the land.
Yokais.

"At least I'm not alone in this world."
"You are alone. I'm you."
"What does that mean?"
"I'm you. From the future."
"So in a perfect loop situation, I'll have to come back here again?"
"Not necessary. This universe doesn't work like that."
Conquerers. Trying to overpower the gods.
Succeed or failure, something like that was decided already.
"You are here as a witness. Sent by the heavens. The witness to the ascension of humanity."
"Such weak creatures that can not be left alone."

5. Body-Swap.
The great ruler. The cold-blooded conquerer of the Heavenly Steps.
A monster who marched through a-thousand-years-standing empire and ground its forces to their bare meat and bones.
Stepping on top of the world.
"Why... am I her?"
A wise scholar. Renowed for his wisdom and unshakable will. He once fended off an entire army of mauraders from the blood sea.
Simply by showing them a projection of kindness. 
Loved... respected, feared.
"Why... am I him?"
Meanwhile... all across the world.
"Why... am I him/her/they/this thing?"
There seems to be a pandemic. Shifting the power-dynamic of this world, throwing it into chaos.
Meanwhile, the cause of all this... the young god of dream...
"Hah, with this, world peace could be achieved with certainty!"
--Naively thinks it would just all work out.
--A grand experiment set into motion by an unknown force once again puts the world at the brink of destruction.
*The problem with this one is that... when it comes to think of 'fun things to do with this concept- 
I can't really think of anything.*
*Just fall back to big dramatic set-piece I guess?*
*How does the setpiece construction system operate again?*
*Either that or the good-ol two people talking climaxes.
*"Combine that together and we'd have dramatic yapping climax."
*"Actually never mind... talking too much isn't necessary a good thing.

6. Myth creation story. Urban flavor. Cyberpunk flavor. Fantasy flavor. Horror flavor. Lovecraftian flavor.
In a world that runs on wordplay.
Just make shit up. Reputation proceeds all.
*"I feel like you're just going to write a story about catfishing people again, Onamazu."*
*No... roleplaying... as myself.*
*"What?"*
*That's it! I'm just gong to write a story where everyone is me--wait...*
*"We kind of did that."*

7. It's only emotional when there's love involed.
